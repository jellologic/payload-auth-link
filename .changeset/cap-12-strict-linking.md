Add per-engine risky account-linking validation at wiring (CAP-12). Both engines gain `logger` and `strictLinking` options: risky settings log a loud `LoggerPort` warning naming the setting by default and throw `InvalidConfigError` under `strictLinking: true`. Better Auth flags `account.accountLinking.trustedProviders` entries without per-provider `requireEmailVerification` (including dynamic trusted-provider functions it cannot verify statically), `allowDifferentEmails: true`, `requireLocalEmailVerified: false`, and `updateUserInfoOnLink: true` — which the engine now also forces off so a link can never rewrite `email`/`emailVerified` in this composition. Auth.js flags any provider with `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true` (the D6 trust combination still always throws). Payload linking keeps requiring a verified email either way.
