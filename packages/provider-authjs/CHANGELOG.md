# @payload-auth-link/provider-authjs

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Make Auth.js verification-token uniqueness composite on `(identifier, token)` instead of `token` alone: `aj-verification-tokens` gains a unique composite `key` field (the same pattern accounts already use) and `token` is no longer uniquely indexed by itself, so identical token hashes — for example two concurrent 6-digit email OTP codes for different addresses — can coexist, while creating the same `(identifier, token)` pair twice is rejected. `useVerificationToken` still looks up by identifier and token together and remains single-use, and rows written before the `key` field existed remain consumable. Hosts own the database migration for the new field, as with any collection change.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Add per-engine risky account-linking validation at wiring (CAP-12). Both engines gain `logger` and `strictLinking` options: risky settings log a loud `LoggerPort` warning naming the setting by default and throw `InvalidConfigError` under `strictLinking: true`. Better Auth flags `account.accountLinking.trustedProviders` entries without per-provider `requireEmailVerification` (including dynamic trusted-provider functions it cannot verify statically), `allowDifferentEmails: true`, `requireLocalEmailVerified: false`, and `updateUserInfoOnLink: true` — which the engine now also forces off so a link can never rewrite `email`/`emailVerified` in this composition. Auth.js flags any provider with `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true` (the D6 trust combination still always throws). Payload linking keeps requiring a verified email either way.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - CAP-14 identity lifecycle foundation: core `IdentityEvent` union and
  `applyIdentityEvent` use-case. Verified provider email changes sync to
  Payload (D9); unverified changes are ignored. Provider unlink/delete
  removes only the identity row via the new required
  `UserRepository.unlinkIdentity` — the Payload user always remains.
  Adapters may expose `IdentityProviderPort.onIdentityEvent`; the plugin
  subscribes at `onInit`. Custom `UserRepository` implementations must
  add `unlinkIdentity` (pre-1.0 minor break for port implementers).

  Both provider adapters now translate lifecycle hooks: Better Auth
  `databaseHooks` (user update/delete, account delete; builder hooks
  preserved, plus `revokeSessionsOnPasswordReset` defaults on) and
  Auth.js `events` (`updateUser`, `linkAccount` — upstream never fires
  unlink/delete events, so Auth.js emits no unlink/delete facts).

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Add the `trustProviderEmailVerification` engine option (D6): an allow-list of OAuth/OIDC provider ids whose asserted `email_verified === true` stamps the adapter user's `emailVerified` through `updateUser`, so trusted OAuth sign-ups can pass the plugin's verified-email gate. Nothing is stamped by default, for non-allow-listed providers, or when `email_verified` is false/absent, and combining a trusted provider with `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking` now fails fast with `InvalidConfigError`. Also exports `createAuthLinkEvents` and `AuthLinkTrustOptions`.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Capabilities Phases 3–7 (PLAN-CAPABILITIES): passwordless, OAuth,
  passkeys, MFA policy, suspend, phone, guests, organizations, SSO.

  Core: session-policy primitives (`effectiveRoles`, `mfaSatisfied`,
  `isSuspendedAt`, `emailDomainAllowed`), `UserSuspendedError`,
  `UserRecord.phone`/`suspendedUntil`, guest principals and their wire
  envelope (`SessionGuest`), verified-phone linking fallback for
  placeholder-email sign-ups, and optional multi-session port methods.

  Plugin: `policies.requireMfaForRoles` (roles withheld without MFA
  proof, `mfaRequired` on the wire), governance fields (`phone`,
  `suspendedUntil`, `suspendReason`) with verify-time suspension and
  best-effort provider revocation, `verified-email-or-phone` linking
  wired end to end (`findByPhone`/`setPhone`), guest sessions on the
  session endpoint, Payload-owned organizations (`organizations:
{ enabled: true }` — collections, manager access, invite/accept
  endpoints, `requireOrgRole`), SSO verified-domain enforcement
  (`organizations.ssoProviders`), multi-session logout sweep, and
  channel-aware CSRF (admitted bearer skips the origin check).

  Better Auth: capabilities derived from installed plugins
  (magic-link, email-otp, oauth, one-tap, passkey, mfa, phone,
  anonymous), phone and placeholder-email claim mapping (SIWE and
  anonymous identities are guests, never email claims),
  `revokeUserSessions`, multi-session enumeration for logout, and a
  fix: `ba-users.name` no longer rejects the empty-string names
  Better Auth's passwordless flows create.

  Auth.js: capabilities derived from configured providers (email →
  magic-link, oauth/oidc → oauth, database sessions →
  revoke-user-sessions, implemented for the database strategy), plus
  CAP-2/CAP-4 recipes — `generateEmailOtpCode`,
  `buildEmailOtpCallbackUrl`, `verifyGoogleIdToken`, and
  `createGoogleOneTapAuthorize`.

  React/web: `guest` on the auth context with `fetchSession`,
  `requireRoles({ requireMfa: true })` throwing typed
  `MfaRequiredError` (including for withheld-role step-ups).

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Core session vocabulary and declared capabilities (PORT-1/PORT-2):
  `ProviderSession` now carries `identity` claims
  (`VerifiedClaim<Email>`/`VerifiedClaim<PhoneNumber>` plus `anonymous`),
  `assurance` (`methods`/`mfa`, `'unknown'` when the provider cannot
  tell), a required `actor`, `organizationId`, and a `channel`
  (`'cookie' | 'bearer' | 'api-key' | 'device'`; one-time tokens present
  as `bearer`, there is no `'one-time'` channel). The flat
  `email`/`emailVerified` fields remain as deprecated aliases of the
  email claim for one minor, and linking now reads the claim. Core adds
  the branded E.164 `PhoneNumber` with `parsePhoneNumber`, plus
  `UnsupportedCapabilityError`, `UnverifiedIdentityError`, and
  `MfaRequiredError`. `IdentityProviderPort` gains a required
  `capabilities: ReadonlySet<Capability>` and an optional
  `revokeUserSessions`. **Breaking for custom adapters (compile
  time):** existing `IdentityProviderPort`/`ProviderSession`
  implementations will not compile until they declare `capabilities`
  and return the new required session fields (`identity`,
  `assurance`, `actor`, `organizationId`, `channel`). This ships as a
  minor under the pre-1.0 policy in `docs/upgrading.md` (minors may
  break option shapes and internal ports; the wire contract is the
  stability anchor). Core also adds `assertCapabilities(provider,
required)`, which throws `UnsupportedCapabilityError` at wiring when
  a capability a policy needs is undeclared, and the plugin enforces
  it (e.g. a phone linking policy requires `'phone'`). Better
  Auth fills the email claim, `mfa` from `user.twoFactorEnabled` when
  declared (else `'unknown'`), `organizationId` from
  `session.activeOrganizationId` when declared (else `null`), declares
  `'impersonation'` only when the Better Auth admin plugin is
  actually installed (observed `channel`: `'bearer'` for
  Authorization-header presentation without the session cookie, else
  `'cookie'`), and reports `methods: 'unknown'` (no per-session
  method upstream). Auth.js fills the email claim with `methods`/`mfa`
  `'unknown'` and declares no capabilities yet.

### Patch Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Impersonation audit hole closed (CAP-8a): Better Auth's
  `session.impersonatedBy` now reaches the port as the new optional
  `ProviderSession.actor` (`{ providerUserId }`, `null` for plain
  sessions; Auth.js always reports `null`), the plugin audit-logs every
  verified use of an impersonated session through `LoggerPort` with the
  operator and target ids, and plugin logout also expires Better Auth's
  `admin_session` cookie via the new optional `logoutCookieNames` port
  field (`getBetterAuthLogoutCookieNames`). All additions are optional
  and backward compatible.

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/4) [`04f8e49`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/04f8e49d79567d3e85b7d34cb91e840f7d9efd74) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Packaging fixes found by verifying 0.1.0 from a clean consumer install:

  - next: `dist` imported `next/headers`, `next/navigation` and
    `next/server` without `.js`, so the adapter crashed under plain
    Node ESM (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). The imports now carry `.js`, and
    lint enforces it.
  - plugin: `@payload-auth-link/plugin/admin` imports `@payloadcms/ui`
    but never declared it. It is now an optional peer dependency (only
    the `/admin` subpath needs it, and Payload apps already have it).
  - all: compiled tests (`dist/**/__tests__`) no longer ship in the
    tarballs (0.1.0 `core` carried 56 test files).
  - all: every package now ships a README, so its npm page explains the
    package, install line with peers, exports, and guides instead of
    "No README data found!".

  This is the first release CI publishes through npm trusted publishing,
  with provenance.

### Minor Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`b010bea`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b010bea61a807e9400ebe944e9424463d7f55085) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Enterprise review hardening.

  Security fixes:

  - Logout now expires session cookies with their live attributes
    (`Secure`, `Domain`, `Path`) reported by each provider through the
    new optional `IdentityProviderPort.sessionCookieClearOptions` hook,
    so `__Secure-` and custom-domain cookies actually die. Providers
    that predate the hook fall back to prefix-derived attributes
    (`expiringCookieOptions`).
  - New `safeRedirectPath` guard in `@payload-auth-link/next`: the
    post-login `redirect` param is attacker-controlled input and must
    never reach the router unvalidated (open redirect).
  - New server authorization helpers `requireSessionUser` /
    `requireRoles` in `@payload-auth-link/next` (throw
    `SessionInvalidError` / `ForbiddenError` by default; pass
    `redirect()` / `notFound()` as handlers). `RequireRoles` is
    UI-hiding only and must never gate content.
  - Auth.js credentials `authorize` burns a dummy scrypt verification
    for unknown emails and hashless rows, closing the
    user-enumeration timing oracle.
  - Session reads anchor to the configured `baseUrl`/`AUTH_URL` origin
    whenever set; the request-host fallback is local-development only
    (host headers are client-spoofable and session cookies are
    forwarded to that origin).

  Strictness and consistency:

  - Better Auth `AdapterOperationError` now extends `AuthLinkError`
    (code `ADAPTER_OPERATION_FAILED`) like its Auth.js twin; it moved
    from `adapter.js` to `errors.js` (barrel import unchanged).
  - Slug overrides validate at wiring time in both providers
    (`resolveSlugs`: non-empty, known models) and collections reject
    slug collisions (`assertUniqueSlugs`), including custom-model
    slugs against core slugs; new `customModelSlug` helper.
  - Shared core building blocks replace nine local copies:
    `isRecord` / `isNonEmptyString` / `toDate` guards,
    `runProviderOperation` port-call wrapper, `denyAllAccess` system
    collection default, `secureCookiePrefix` / `hostCookiePrefix`
    constants. The Edge-safe `/cookies` subpaths keep local literals
    (runtime-import-free) pinned to core by tests.
  - `CookieOptions` gains `partitioned`; `SessionVerifier` is now a
    named export.

### Patch Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`70e87c3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/70e87c3c3bfdda54f9ebdca5b074ac2635f7aed8) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Close the low-severity review backlog. Every change fails closed; see
  docs/upgrading.md.

  - core: `safeRedirectPath` moves to core with a destination policy
    that refuses the sign-in page and `/api` (`SafeRedirectOptions`).
    New exports: `isCookieName` and `SafeRedirectOptions`. Cookie
    `Domain`/`Path` values that could inject attributes or split
    headers throw. Provider registration rejects illegal session cookie
    names. `validateStartupConfig` drops the unused `secret`.
  - plugin: `secret` is deprecated and ignored. An empty provider
    session id is a 401, not a 500. Logout already sweeps every
    provider (PAR-7).
  - web: `requireRoles` validates its roles (`InvalidRoleError`, and
    `InvalidConfigError` for an empty list). It re-exports
    `SafeRedirectOptions`.
  - react: `SignOutButton` narrows `redirectTo`. `AuthLinkProvider`
    syncs a changed `initialUser` (value-compared, so a client sign-out
    is never undone by an equal snapshot).
  - next, tanstack-start: re-export the whole web surface through one
    shared statement, so adapters cannot drift (now includes
    `SafeRedirectOptions`).
  - provider-authjs: `authorize` lowercases the email. A corrupt
    `emailVerified` throws `AdapterMappingError`. Gapped session chunk
    sets are malformed.
  - provider-better-auth: adapter rows assert `baId` and date fields,
    and throw `AdapterOperationError` on storage drift.

- Updated dependencies [[`70e87c3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/70e87c3c3bfdda54f9ebdca5b074ac2635f7aed8), [`b010bea`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b010bea61a807e9400ebe944e9424463d7f55085)]:
