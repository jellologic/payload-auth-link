# @payload-auth-link/next

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#111](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/111) [`75212b3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/75212b36d96c5d9b5cdad29c842809b65c2a87db) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - One minor across every package, from the re-validation of 0.12.0 ([#110](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/110)). This release:

  - **plugin**:
    - linking a provider identity clears the document's Payload API key, and API keys on provider-linked documents are refused unless `allowLocalCredentialsForLinkedDocs` is set;
    - the linking-proof grant guidance is corrected, and collision refusals now point to resolving the collision;
    - impersonated organization endpoint calls always answer the audited 403;
    - `authLinkServer(payload)` works across bundler module copies (TanStack Start).
  - **provider-authjs**: the session endpoint returns an allowlisted shape (`user` name/email/image/id/emailVerified, plus `expires`) on both session strategies.
  - **provider-better-auth**:
    - logout expires the chunked cookie-cache and `account_data` cookies;
    - a correct second factor on an existing session deterministically marks it MFA-proven;
    - `not_in` keeps NULL rows, and case-insensitive `eq` matches non-ASCII text on SQLite;
    - `verifyApiKey` refuses organization-owned and orphaned keys (`UnsupportedApiKeyOwnerError`).
  - **migrate**:
    - the manifest signature covers `finalized`, and `finalize` records a one-way marker in the app database;
    - rollback deletes only the import's own target rows, and a failed delete exits non-zero;
    - unsigned manifests cannot delete without `--allow-unsigned-deletes`;
    - `export --source-map` is added, and `verify` uses the configured roles field;
    - a second `--apply` is a true no-op, and there are new doctor checks.
  - **Tests and CI**:
    - coverage is now measured on sources, with per-file floors;
    - the vitest inline patterns are anchored;
    - several security-matrix rows are pinned on real engines;
    - the examples type-check with generated Payload types in CI.

  Upgrade impact: no schema change, and nothing to run for push or migrations on any adapter. The operator steps are in `docs/upgrading.md`:

  - move service integrations off linked users' API keys;
  - `finalize` now needs `--config`;
  - pass `--slugs` to `rollback` when the import used custom slugs;
  - clients that read `sessionToken`, `userId` or `id` from the Auth.js session JSON must expose those fields from their own `session` callback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`75212b3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/75212b36d96c5d9b5cdad29c842809b65c2a87db)]:
  - @payload-auth-link/core@0.9.0
  - @payload-auth-link/web@0.5.0
  - @payload-auth-link/react@0.5.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#108](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/108) [`b718ac4`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b718ac4fe66266b28eb4decd895b0f15452bdbf5) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - One minor across every package. It follows a re-validation of every published security advisory against the current source, and closes the adjacent gaps that pass found.

  - **migrate: signed manifests** (follow-up to GHSA-p76j-5qwx-rpwx). The 0.5.0 fix sealed each captured value. Two edits were still accepted:
    - a plaintext `before` entry on any allowlisted field, `roles` included;
    - extra `created` rows, which rollback deletes with `overrideAccess`.

    Manifests are now version 3, with an HMAC-SHA256 over the whole file keyed from `PAYLOAD_SECRET`. `rollback`, and a resumed `--apply` / `adopt-prelink`, refuse a manifest that fails the check. Older unsigned manifests need `--allow-unsigned-manifest` once.

  - **plugin: users `readVersions` default.** When the host leaves it unset, it is now role managers only. Before, `/api/users/versions` listed every user's versions, emails included, to any signed-in user on a users collection with `versions` enabled.
  - **plugin: `roleValues` on local sessions.** The role-manager check and the `requireMfaForRoles` strip now compare canonical roles. A local session holding a mapped MFA-policy role kept it without MFA, and a local admin stored under a mapped value was not a role manager.
  - **Release path:** moved to `changesets/action` v2.1.2 ([#102](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/102)). Version PR commits and release tags are pushed through the GitHub API at the CI-tested SHA.
  - **Lint:** a new rule forbids `console.*` and `process.stdout`/`stderr` in package sources, outside the logger sink and the migrate CLI. This keeps the debug writes removed by GHSA-hxgq-9pww-59j4 from coming back.
  - **Dependencies:** Payload 3.91.0 is the tested `latest` on v3; the peer range is unchanged. The remaining `bun audit` findings are triaged in `SECURITY.md`, and none reaches a published package.

  Upgrade impact: no schema change, and nothing to run for push or migrations on any adapter. Operator steps are in `docs/upgrading.md`: pass `--allow-unsigned-manifest` once if you are mid-migration with a manifest written by migrate ≤ 0.5.x. A host that relied on non-managers reading user versions must declare `access.readVersions`.

- Updated dependencies [[`b718ac4`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b718ac4fe66266b28eb4decd895b0f15452bdbf5)]:

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#89](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/89) [`60deb7d`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/60deb7db81c1a74c9a3b0bc5c60f52e4c61f0c79) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Release and supply-chain hardening ([#85](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/85)).

  - Every package tarball now ships the MIT `LICENSE` (previously no
    tarball carried it).
  - Releases publish only after the full CI workflow passes on the exact
    commit, from a dedicated `npm-publish` environment, with npm
    provenance. Local publishing is refused outside an explicit,
    documented emergency override.
  - `@payload-auth-link/migrate`: the published `.d.ts` no longer
    references `pg`, so consumers type-checking with
    `skipLibCheck: false` no longer fail with TS7016 (no `@types/pg`
    needed). `openSource` and the source readers (`probeSourceLayout`,
    `countTables`, `readSourceUsers`, `readFlatRows`, `findOrphans`) now
    type their client as the new exported structural `SourceClient`
    (`query` + `end`); a `pg.Client` still satisfies it. Code that used
    `openSource()`'s result as a full `pg.Client` must narrow to those
    two methods or open its own `pg` client.
  - `@payload-auth-link/migrate`: the TypeScript compiler API is loaded
    lazily, only by the `codemod` command; importing the package or
    running `doctor`/import/export no longer loads it.

  Upgrade impact: none for stored data or schemas (no collection shape
  changed). Type-level only for `@payload-auth-link/migrate` API
  consumers, as described above.

- [#89](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/89) [`d210efe`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/d210efe66ed560e2a8394c399e4b64695219dc71) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Harden the server-side session verifier's origin resolution.

  - `createSessionVerifier` now requires `baseUrl` (or an absolute `sessionEndpoint`) unless `NODE_ENV` is exactly `'development'`; unset, `test`, `staging`, `preview`, and `production` all throw `InvalidConfigError` at construction.
  - In development, the host fallback ignores `X-Forwarded-Host`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` unless the new `trustProxy` option is set, accepts only `http`/`https`, and only resolves to hosts in `allowedDevelopmentHosts` (default `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). Rejections fail closed and are reported through `onError`.
  - Protocol-relative and non-http `sessionEndpoint` values throw at construction (new `validateSessionEndpoint` export).
  - The verifier fetch aborts after `timeoutMs` (default 5000, new `defaultSessionVerifierTimeoutMs` export) and does not follow redirects; both fail closed.
  - `resolveSessionUrl`'s host fallback now defaults to off and takes a host policy; core's `resolveOrigin` gains `trustProxy` and `allowedHosts` and validates the scheme and host. The Auth.js engine keeps reading forwarded headers explicitly for its in-process session read.
  - `packages/next/README.md`: the middleware snippet resolves cookie names with `getBetterAuthSessionCookieNames` (so `__Secure-` names match on https) and ships a matcher.

  Upgrade impact: no schema change. Apps constructing a verifier without `baseUrl` outside `NODE_ENV=development` must pass `baseUrl`; dev setups behind a local proxy set `trustProxy: true` (and `allowedDevelopmentHosts` for non-loopback dev hosts). See `docs/upgrading.md`.

### Minor Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/29) [`179e561`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/179e56120a07cde1878d368099fe496296bc8e9f) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Verified fixes from the code-read sweep (issue [#21](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/21)):

  - **Organization membership uniqueness.** The memberships collection
    gains a compound **unique index on `(user, organization)`**: two
    concurrent invite-accepts (or owner-bootstrap hooks) could
    previously both pass the check-then-insert and land duplicate rows.
    Existing databases with duplicates must dedupe before the index
    builds (see docs/upgrading.md).
  - **`setEmail` keeps identity rows in step.** Changing a user's email
    now rewrites linked-identity rows that carried the old address, so
    the admin users view no longer shows a stale identity email.
  - **Role-config audit is bounded and its truncation note is
    reachable.** The startup audit no longer passes `pagination: false`
    (which ignored the 500-doc limit and made the truncation message
    unreachable); the note now fires when more users exist than were
    scanned.
  - **Impersonation in custom endpoints: proven, not assumed.** The
    "is `req.user` populated here?" doubt is settled by a test — the
    organization-create endpoint's impersonation deny fires on a real
    impersonated session.
  - **`checkAuthCookies(request, options)`** (next): composable form of
    the optimistic middleware — returns the 303 sign-in redirect or
    `null` — for apps that run their own `proxy.ts` (Next 16) /
    `middleware.ts` pipeline.

  Upgrade impact: new unique index on the memberships collection
  (dedupe existing duplicates first — per-adapter notes in
  docs/upgrading.md); `setEmail` now also writes the `identities` array
  when address-bearing rows change; the startup role audit's query
  shape changes (bounded, paginated).

- Updated dependencies [[`59ebe9c`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/59ebe9c9ec0a2f21917873a100b8f2f14d4da008)]:

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8ef5975`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/8ef59750f5cc42de7488587b2f3d47abe59202bd) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Version-range honesty (upgrade-resilience Phase 1): declared ranges
  now equal the CI-tested bands, and unvalidated upstreams fail at
  boot, typed, before any database write.

  - **`better-auth` and `@auth/core` are peer dependencies.** The
    providers no longer install them transitively; install the version
    you configure (validated bands: `better-auth >=1.7.6 <1.8.0`,
    `@auth/core >=0.41.0 <0.42.0`). Floors are bisected: BA 1.7.6
    (adapter `modelKey` types), @auth/core 0.41.0.
  - **`payload` peers tighten to `^3.83.0 || 4.0.0-beta.0`** (3.83.0
    is the named-plugin/global-hook floor; the v4 entry is the exact
    tested beta — canaries were silently inside the old caret). The
    plugin's runtime band matches the manifest.
  - **Framework peers get honest floors**: `next` `^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0`
    (both majors typechecked, 16.4 e2e-tested), TanStack Start
    `^1.140.2` (first `createMiddleware` types) with react-router
    `^1.170.0`.
  - **Runtime assertions at wiring time**: the providers check their
    upstream's installed version (`supportedBetterAuthBand`,
    `supportedAuthJsBand`, `assertBetterAuthVersion`,
    `assertAuthJsCoreVersion` exported; core adds
    `readInstalledVersion`) and throw `UnsupportedVersionError`
    before any collection write; unreadable manifests warn once and
    skip, never guess.
  - CI: a scheduled/dispatchable `compat` workflow proves
    {floor, latest} per upstream plus the golden Postgres/Mongo
    upgrade tests, with a non-blocking canary for drift; dependabot
    keeps installed versions moving as reviewed PRs.

  Upgrade impact: none for the database. Install-level: add explicit
  `better-auth` / `@auth/core` installs when adopting the providers
  (the READMEs show the lines); payload below 3.83.0 and prerelease
  payload canaries are no longer accepted. See docs/upgrading.md
  § 0.2.x → 0.3.0.

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/4) [`04f8e49`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/04f8e49d79567d3e85b7d34cb91e840f7d9efd74) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Packaging fixes found by verifying 0.1.0 from a clean consumer install:

  - next: `dist` imported `next/headers`, `next/navigation` and
    `next/server` without `.js`, so the adapter crashed under plain
    Node ESM (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). The imports now carry `.js`, and
    lint enforces it.
  - plugin: `@payload-auth-link/plugin/admin` imports `@payloadcms/ui`
    but never declared it. It is now an optional peer dependency (only
    the `/admin` subpath needs it, and Payload apps already have it).
  - all: compiled tests (`dist/**/__tests__`) no longer ship in the
    tarballs (0.1.0 `core` carried 56 test files).
  - all: every package now ships a README, so its npm page explains the
    package, install line with peers, exports, and guides instead of
    "No README data found!".

  This is the first release CI publishes through npm trusted publishing,
  with provenance.

- Updated dependencies [[`04f8e49`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/04f8e49d79567d3e85b7d34cb91e840f7d9efd74)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`b010bea`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b010bea61a807e9400ebe944e9424463d7f55085) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Enterprise review hardening.

  Security fixes:

  - Logout now expires session cookies with their live attributes
    (`Secure`, `Domain`, `Path`) reported by each provider through the
    new optional `IdentityProviderPort.sessionCookieClearOptions` hook,
    so `__Secure-` and custom-domain cookies actually die. Providers
    that predate the hook fall back to prefix-derived attributes
    (`expiringCookieOptions`).
  - New `safeRedirectPath` guard in `@payload-auth-link/next`: the
    post-login `redirect` param is attacker-controlled input and must
    never reach the router unvalidated (open redirect).
  - New server authorization helpers `requireSessionUser` /
    `requireRoles` in `@payload-auth-link/next` (throw
    `SessionInvalidError` / `ForbiddenError` by default; pass
    `redirect()` / `notFound()` as handlers). `RequireRoles` is
    UI-hiding only and must never gate content.
  - Auth.js credentials `authorize` burns a dummy scrypt verification
    for unknown emails and hashless rows, closing the
    user-enumeration timing oracle.
  - Session reads anchor to the configured `baseUrl`/`AUTH_URL` origin
    whenever set; the request-host fallback is local-development only
    (host headers are client-spoofable and session cookies are
    forwarded to that origin).

  Strictness and consistency:

  - Better Auth `AdapterOperationError` now extends `AuthLinkError`
    (code `ADAPTER_OPERATION_FAILED`) like its Auth.js twin; it moved
    from `adapter.js` to `errors.js` (barrel import unchanged).
  - Slug overrides validate at wiring time in both providers
    (`resolveSlugs`: non-empty, known models) and collections reject
    slug collisions (`assertUniqueSlugs`), including custom-model
    slugs against core slugs; new `customModelSlug` helper.
  - Shared core building blocks replace nine local copies:
    `isRecord` / `isNonEmptyString` / `toDate` guards,
    `runProviderOperation` port-call wrapper, `denyAllAccess` system
    collection default, `secureCookiePrefix` / `hostCookiePrefix`
    constants. The Edge-safe `/cookies` subpaths keep local literals
    (runtime-import-free) pinned to core by tests.
  - `CookieOptions` gains `partitioned`; `SessionVerifier` is now a
    named export.

### Patch Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`70e87c3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/70e87c3c3bfdda54f9ebdca5b074ac2635f7aed8) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Close the low-severity review backlog. Every change fails closed; see
  docs/upgrading.md.

  - core: `safeRedirectPath` moves to core with a destination policy
    that refuses the sign-in page and `/api` (`SafeRedirectOptions`).
    New exports: `isCookieName` and `SafeRedirectOptions`. Cookie
    `Domain`/`Path` values that could inject attributes or split
    headers throw. Provider registration rejects illegal session cookie
    names. `validateStartupConfig` drops the unused `secret`.
  - plugin: `secret` is deprecated and ignored. An empty provider
    session id is a 401, not a 500. Logout already sweeps every
    provider (PAR-7).
  - web: `requireRoles` validates its roles (`InvalidRoleError`, and
    `InvalidConfigError` for an empty list). It re-exports
    `SafeRedirectOptions`.
  - react: `SignOutButton` narrows `redirectTo`. `AuthLinkProvider`
    syncs a changed `initialUser` (value-compared, so a client sign-out
    is never undone by an equal snapshot).
  - next, tanstack-start: re-export the whole web surface through one
    shared statement, so adapters cannot drift (now includes
    `SafeRedirectOptions`).
  - provider-authjs: `authorize` lowercases the email. A corrupt
    `emailVerified` throws `AdapterMappingError`. Gapped session chunk
    sets are malformed.
  - provider-better-auth: adapter rows assert `baId` and date fields,
    and throw `AdapterOperationError` on storage drift.

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`b010bea`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b010bea61a807e9400ebe944e9424463d7f55085) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - TanStack Start as a first-class citizen alongside Next.js.

  New packages:

  - `@payload-auth-link/web`: the framework-free web surface
    (`createRouteHandlers`, `createSessionVerifier`, `requireRoles` /
    `requireSessionUser`, `safeRedirectPath`), moved verbatim from
    `next`. No behavior change; `next` re-exports it so existing
    imports keep working.
  - `@payload-auth-link/tanstack-start` (Payload v4):
    `createServerRouteHandlers` for `server.handlers`,
    `createAuthRequestMiddleware` (over the shared `decideAuthRedirect`)
    for `src/start.ts`, `getSessionUserFromRequest` /
    `createSessionLoader` for server functions and hydration,
    `useAuthLinkRefreshStart` for post-auth refresh, and a
    `beforeLoad` guard recipe over shared `requireRoles`. Re-exports
    `web` for the same one-import DX as `next`.

  - Better Auth engine passes `options.plugins` through verbatim:
    builders declare the framework cookie plugin themselves
    (`nextCookies()` on Next.js, `tanstackStartCookies()` on
