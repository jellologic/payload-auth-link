# @payload-auth-link/core

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/81) [`d20684e`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/d20684e5e8a1602e3b8e6de37ce494112c250c94) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Better Auth's native sign-in flows record their authentication method, and session ids become opaque handles (issues [#79](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/79) and [#80](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/80)).

  - **`requireMfaForRoles` works through Better Auth's own 2FA again ([#79](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/79)).** 0.10.1's assurance read the per-session `authenticationMethod` column, but only server-side mints wrote it — a user completing BA's native two-factor sign-in got `mfa: 'unknown'` and their MFA-gated role stayed withheld. The provenance plugin now stamps the method on every recognized sign-in flow (`password`, `two-factor` on the verification endpoints, `oauth` callbacks, `magic-link`, `email-otp`, `passkey`); BA's 2FA-pending sign-in expires the session cookie, so a single-factor session is never relabelled — the second factor issues a FRESH session recorded as `two-factor`. Unknown paths still record nothing (fail closed).
  - **Session ids are opaque handles, never bearer tokens ([#80](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/80)).** `listSessions` and `createSessionFor().sessionId` return the session row id instead of the raw token — a devices page could otherwise expose one live credential per session into page data, logs, and error reports. `revokeSession` resolves the handle server-side and keeps its verified-deletion semantics; BA's own logout internals (which revoke by token) are unaffected. `createSessionFor().token` and `sessionCookie(token)` are unchanged — the token still rides exactly where setting the cookie needs it.

  Upgrade impact: no stored data changes (the column exists since 0.10.1). Behavior: MFA-gated roles through BA's native 2FA are restored without a custom step-up route; consumers that treated `listSessions` ids as tokens must switch to the opaque handles (revocation accepts both shapes).

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [`5c76018`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/5c76018ad084e58ec2fc483a811a66b803f21bbe) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - The server session API is hardened: minted sessions carry explicit, recorded assurance; one id type across mint/list/revoke with verified deletion; the requested TTL is honored and the stored expiry audited; `'dev-only'` means development.

  - **Assurance reads a per-session record, not an enrollment flag.** The engine appends an internal Better Auth plugin adding one nullable `authenticationMethod` session field; mints record `server-mint` (no 2FA challenge ran — `mfa: false`), a server-vouched step-up records `server-step-up` (`mfa: true`). The old read leaned on `user.twoFactorEnabled`, so every mint for a 2FA-enrolled user claimed a second factor that never ran. Sign-in sessions without a recorded method report `mfa: 'unknown'`, which the MFA gate treats as absent (fail-closed) — restore gated roles via `createSessionFor(userId, { mfaProof: true })`, only where the server verified the second factor itself. `authLinkServer.sessionCookie`/`createSessionFor().setCookie` unchanged in shape.
  - **`revokeSession` consumes the ids `listSessions` and `createSessionFor` hand out** (the session token — previously they returned row ids while revocation deleted by token, so revokes deleted nothing and reported success), and is verified: an id with no session behind it, or a delete that leaves the row in place, is an error.
  - **Mint TTL honored and audited honestly.** The expiry was landing in Better Auth's `dontRememberMe` slot (every mint got ~24h regardless of the request, with the audit recording the requested value as if stored); it now goes through Better Auth's `override`, and the audit event and returned `expiresAt` carry the STORED expiry (`createSessionFor` result gains nothing breaking; providers report `storedExpiresAt`).
  - **`'dev-only'` (the `allowServerSessions` default) enables minting ONLY on `NODE_ENV === 'development'`** — previously on everything except `'production'`, which silently armed minting in CI, test and staging.

  Upgrade impact: the engine's session table gains one additive, nullable column through Better Auth's own schema machinery — run the usual Payload push/migrations; no data changes. Behaviour: MFA-gated roles are withheld for sessions with no recorded method until a `mfaProof` mint or a method-recording flow; `'dev-only'` now refuses minting outside development (set `allowServerSessions: true` explicitly). CI/test code that relied on the old default must opt in.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/73) [`6eb5e57`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/6eb5e57824ac8cbd4ad14b03bda851d103d7a94c) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - The server-session API's cookie is actually signed, and the server API is stricter about providers (issues [#68](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/68)–[#72](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/72) correctness pass, found in the first production rehearsal).

  - **`sessionCookie(token)` now returns `Promise<string>`** on `authLinkServer(payload)` and the provider port, and emits Better Auth's SIGNED form (`token.<HMAC>` — BA reads the session cookie with `getSignedCookie` only, so 0.9.0's raw-token cookie resolved no session). The cookie is built from the engine's own resolved context: secret, cookie name, and the real `Secure`/`SameSite`/`Path`/`Max-Age` attributes. `createSessionFor().setCookie` carries the signed value; await the call.
  - **`revokeAllForUser` and `listSessions` walk every linked provider**, not just the first capable identity — with two linked providers, the second provider's sessions were neither listed nor revoked.
  - **`sessionCookie(token)` refuses ambiguity**: with several cookie-transport providers registered it throws instead of silently signing with the wrong one (`createSessionFor` remains the unambiguous path).
  - **`legacySessions` on the plugin now enforces agreement** with the engine's window at config time (`InvalidConfigError` on missing, disagreeing, or colliding windows; engine-only configuration stays legal — the engine input is what acts).
  - **`admin: { loginView: 'provider' }` renders**: the registration gains its `exportName` and the view signs in through Better Auth's `POST /sign-in/email` (the old `/api/auth/sign-in` link was never a route), with a two-factor-aware response and a path for social-only accounts. Requires a cookie-transport provider (config-time error otherwise), and **apps enabling it must regenerate the Payload import map** (`payload generate:importmap`).

  Upgrade impact: type-level — `await sessionCookie(…)` at call sites; behavior-level — hosts that set only the plugin's `legacySessions` option must move the window to the engine input (the plugin option now asserts it); hosts using `loginView: 'provider'` regenerate the import map. No collection shapes change; no stored data is touched.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`408b579`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/408b5799d2642c8734ea9752a6df73218ccc389c) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Supported server session API (issue [#54](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/54)): `authLinkServer(payload)` —
  `getSession` (same rules as the strategies), `createSessionFor` (audited,
  refused for suspended users, gated by `allowServerSessions`:
  `'dev-only'` default | `true` | `false`), `listSessions`,
  `revokeSession`, `revokeAllForUser`, `verifyApiKey`, and
  `sessionCookie` — so apps never touch Better Auth internals or
  hand-sign cookies. Provider capability-gated (`server-session-create`,
  `server-session-list`, `api-key-verify`); Better Auth implements all
  three, Auth.js reports none and the server API refuses with typed
  errors. `Upgrade impact:` none — additive.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/28) [`59ebe9c`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/59ebe9c9ec0a2f21917873a100b8f2f14d4da008) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - The plugin is audible by default (issue [#15](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/issues/15)): `authLink({ logger })`
  now defaults to a **console logger** instead of the silent one, so
  session refusals (expired, channel not admitted, suspended,
  provider errors, a session-shaped cookie that resolves to nothing)
  and the impersonation audit actually land somewhere without
  configuration. `nullLogger()` remains the explicit opt-out.

  - Core adds `consoleLogger()` (info/warn/error to the matching
    console level, fields as a JSON suffix, debug stays silent) and
    `isSilentLogger()`.
  - New `onAudit` option: a durable sink called with every
    impersonation audit event, in addition to the logger — "audited"
    should survive log rotation. With an impersonation-capable
    provider, a silent logger, and no `onAudit`, the plugin warns once
    at startup through the console that audit events are being
    dropped.
  - The per-request "verification failed: invalid session" residue
    (every anonymous request) moved to debug level; every actionable
    refusal keeps its warning with reason, provider, and channel.
  - README's impersonation row now says what auditing means.

  Upgrade impact: default-behaviour change — servers will print
  warnings for refused sessions by default. Pass
  `logger: nullLogger()` to restore silence; pass `onAudit` to make
  the impersonation audit durable.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8ef5975`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/8ef59750f5cc42de7488587b2f3d47abe59202bd) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Version-range honesty (upgrade-resilience Phase 1): declared ranges
  now equal the CI-tested bands, and unvalidated upstreams fail at
  boot, typed, before any database write.

  - **`better-auth` and `@auth/core` are peer dependencies.** The
    providers no longer install them transitively; install the version
    you configure (validated bands: `better-auth >=1.7.6 <1.8.0`,
    `@auth/core >=0.41.0 <0.42.0`). Floors are bisected: BA 1.7.6
    (adapter `modelKey` types), @auth/core 0.41.0.
  - **`payload` peers tighten to `^3.83.0 || 4.0.0-beta.0`** (3.83.0
    is the named-plugin/global-hook floor; the v4 entry is the exact
    tested beta — canaries were silently inside the old caret). The
    plugin's runtime band matches the manifest.
  - **Framework peers get honest floors**: `next` `^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0`
    (both majors typechecked, 16.4 e2e-tested), TanStack Start
    `^1.140.2` (first `createMiddleware` types) with react-router
    `^1.170.0`.
  - **Runtime assertions at wiring time**: the providers check their
    upstream's installed version (`supportedBetterAuthBand`,
    `supportedAuthJsBand`, `assertBetterAuthVersion`,
    `assertAuthJsCoreVersion` exported; core adds
    `readInstalledVersion`) and throw `UnsupportedVersionError`
    before any collection write; unreadable manifests warn once and
    skip, never guess.
  - CI: a scheduled/dispatchable `compat` workflow proves
    {floor, latest} per upstream plus the golden Postgres/Mongo
    upgrade tests, with a non-blocking canary for drift; dependabot
    keeps installed versions moving as reviewed PRs.

  Upgrade impact: none for the database. Install-level: add explicit
  `better-auth` / `@auth/core` installs when adopting the providers
  (the READMEs show the lines); payload below 3.83.0 and prerelease
  payload canaries are no longer accepted. See docs/upgrading.md
  § 0.2.x → 0.3.0.

- [`8ef5975`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/8ef59750f5cc42de7488587b2f3d47abe59202bd) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Type-safe upgrade alarms and schema interoperability (upgrade-resilience Phase 3b):

  - Core: `authMethods` exported as the single source for `AuthMethod` and the session wire enum; `sessionChannels` is now a const tuple with `SessionChannel` derived from it; `LinkingPolicy` derives from `linkingPolicySchema`. Union/schema drift now fails typecheck instead of degrading sessions at runtime.
  - Core: `parseSessionUser` accepts `ParseSessionUserOptions.onDegrade` with a typed `SessionUserDegradeReason`, so producer/consumer version skew (e.g. an unknown auth method from a newer server) is observable instead of silent. Default behavior is unchanged.
  - Core: every exported Zod schema is pinned as a Standard Schema v1 (`@standard-schema/spec` added); Zod and Effect Schema compose through `~standard`. Effect interop is covered by a CI test with `effect` as a devDependency only. The `zod: ^4.0.0` floor and a consumer TypeScript floor of 5.5 are now probe-proven and documented.
  - Plugin: stored-row mapping warnings aggregate once per kind per logger instead of once per corrupt row.
  - Better Auth provider: exhaustive `assertNever` guards on custom-field types and where operators, so new upstream variants fail CI typecheck.
  - Repo gates: public-API `.d.ts` snapshots (`bun run api:check`) and a `skipLibCheck: false` consumer fixture (`bun run consumer:check`) now run in `bun run check`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Channel admission (CAP-13a) and impersonation completion (CAP-8b).

  - The plugin gains `admitChannels` (default `['cookie']`): a live
    provider session presented on a non-admitted channel (`bearer`,
    `api-key`, `device`) is refused at verification with the new typed
    `ChannelNotAdmittedError` (401) before any linking, and
    verification stops at the presenting provider. Channels are
    observed, not asserted: Better Auth reports `'bearer'` when the
    session arrives via an `Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED]` header without
    the session cookie (denied by the default policy), and Auth.js
    reports `'cookie'` because it only reads cookie-presented
    sessions. CSRF is unchanged in this phase.
  - `Session.actor` / `SessionUser.actor` are now the resolved
    `ResolvedSessionActor` discriminated union: `payload-user` (with
    the operator's Payload `userId`, resolved through
    `UserRepository.findByProviderIdentity`) or `provider-only` (no
    linked Payload user — fail-closed: still audited and restricted,
    never presented as a Payload id, logged as a warning).
    `parseSessionUser` accepts the legacy `{ providerUserId }` form
    and normalizes it to `provider-only`; `ProviderSession.actor`
    keeps the provider form.
  - Every authenticated Payload collection/global operation performed
    while impersonating is audit-logged through `LoggerPort`
    (`impersonated operation`: actor, target, operation,
    collection/global, document id) via plugin-installed
    `beforeOperation` hooks, so denied attempts are audited too.
  - Default impersonation restrictions (D5): the plugin denies
    admin-panel access and roles-field writes on the users collection
    while an actor is present (reads allowed), and exports
    `denyWhileImpersonating(ops?)`, the fail-closed
    `isImpersonating(req)` / `impersonationStateFromRequest(req)`
    server extraction (a present-but-malformed `actor` still denies
    and audits; authorization never routes through the client wire
    parser), plus `impersonationActorFromRequest` for attribution, so
    builders can apply the same default — deny admin and writes,
    allow reads — to their own collections.

  See `docs/upgrading.md`.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - CAP-14 identity lifecycle foundation: core `IdentityEvent` union and
  `applyIdentityEvent` use-case. Verified provider email changes sync to
  Payload (D9); unverified changes are ignored. Provider unlink/delete
  removes only the identity row via the new required
  `UserRepository.unlinkIdentity` — the Payload user always remains.
  Adapters may expose `IdentityProviderPort.onIdentityEvent`; the plugin
  subscribes at `onInit`. Custom `UserRepository` implementations must
  add `unlinkIdentity` (pre-1.0 minor break for port implementers).

  Both provider adapters now translate lifecycle hooks: Better Auth
  `databaseHooks` (user update/delete, account delete; builder hooks
  preserved, plus `revokeSessionsOnPasswordReset` defaults on) and
  Auth.js `events` (`updateUser`, `linkAccount` — upstream never fires
  unlink/delete events, so Auth.js emits no unlink/delete facts).

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Impersonation audit hole closed (CAP-8a): Better Auth's
  `session.impersonatedBy` now reaches the port as the new optional
  `ProviderSession.actor` (`{ providerUserId }`, `null` for plain
  sessions; Auth.js always reports `null`), the plugin audit-logs every
  verified use of an impersonated session through `LoggerPort` with the
  operator and target ids, and plugin logout also expires Better Auth's
  `admin_session` cookie via the new optional `logoutCookieNames` port
  field (`getBetterAuthLogoutCookieNames`). All additions are optional
  and backward compatible.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Capabilities Phases 3–7 (PLAN-CAPABILITIES): passwordless, OAuth,
  passkeys, MFA policy, suspend, phone, guests, organizations, SSO.

  Core: session-policy primitives (`effectiveRoles`, `mfaSatisfied`,
  `isSuspendedAt`, `emailDomainAllowed`), `UserSuspendedError`,
  `UserRecord.phone`/`suspendedUntil`, guest principals and their wire
  envelope (`SessionGuest`), verified-phone linking fallback for
  placeholder-email sign-ups, and optional multi-session port methods.

  Plugin: `policies.requireMfaForRoles` (roles withheld without MFA
  proof, `mfaRequired` on the wire), governance fields (`phone`,
  `suspendedUntil`, `suspendReason`) with verify-time suspension and
  best-effort provider revocation, `verified-email-or-phone` linking
  wired end to end (`findByPhone`/`setPhone`), guest sessions on the
  session endpoint, Payload-owned organizations (`organizations:
{ enabled: true }` — collections, manager access, invite/accept
  endpoints, `requireOrgRole`), SSO verified-domain enforcement
  (`organizations.ssoProviders`), multi-session logout sweep, and
  channel-aware CSRF (admitted bearer skips the origin check).

  Better Auth: capabilities derived from installed plugins
  (magic-link, email-otp, oauth, one-tap, passkey, mfa, phone,
  anonymous), phone and placeholder-email claim mapping (SIWE and
  anonymous identities are guests, never email claims),
  `revokeUserSessions`, multi-session enumeration for logout, and a
  fix: `ba-users.name` no longer rejects the empty-string names
  Better Auth's passwordless flows create.

  Auth.js: capabilities derived from configured providers (email →
  magic-link, oauth/oidc → oauth, database sessions →
  revoke-user-sessions, implemented for the database strategy), plus
  CAP-2/CAP-4 recipes — `generateEmailOtpCode`,
  `buildEmailOtpCallbackUrl`, `verifyGoogleIdToken`, and
  `createGoogleOneTapAuthorize`.

  React/web: `guest` on the auth context with `fetchSession`,
  `requireRoles({ requireMfa: true })` throwing typed
  `MfaRequiredError` (including for withheld-role step-ups).

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Core session vocabulary and declared capabilities (PORT-1/PORT-2):
  `ProviderSession` now carries `identity` claims
  (`VerifiedClaim<Email>`/`VerifiedClaim<PhoneNumber>` plus `anonymous`),
  `assurance` (`methods`/`mfa`, `'unknown'` when the provider cannot
  tell), a required `actor`, `organizationId`, and a `channel`
  (`'cookie' | 'bearer' | 'api-key' | 'device'`; one-time tokens present
  as `bearer`, there is no `'one-time'` channel). The flat
  `email`/`emailVerified` fields remain as deprecated aliases of the
  email claim for one minor, and linking now reads the claim. Core adds
  the branded E.164 `PhoneNumber` with `parsePhoneNumber`, plus
  `UnsupportedCapabilityError`, `UnverifiedIdentityError`, and
  `MfaRequiredError`. `IdentityProviderPort` gains a required
  `capabilities: ReadonlySet<Capability>` and an optional
  `revokeUserSessions`. **Breaking for custom adapters (compile
  time):** existing `IdentityProviderPort`/`ProviderSession`
  implementations will not compile until they declare `capabilities`
  and return the new required session fields (`identity`,
  `assurance`, `actor`, `organizationId`, `channel`). This ships as a
  minor under the pre-1.0 policy in `docs/upgrading.md` (minors may
  break option shapes and internal ports; the wire contract is the
  stability anchor). Core also adds `assertCapabilities(provider,
required)`, which throws `UnsupportedCapabilityError` at wiring when
  a capability a policy needs is undeclared, and the plugin enforces
  it (e.g. a phone linking policy requires `'phone'`). Better
  Auth fills the email claim, `mfa` from `user.twoFactorEnabled` when
  declared (else `'unknown'`), `organizationId` from
  `session.activeOrganizationId` when declared (else `null`), declares
  `'impersonation'` only when the Better Auth admin plugin is
  actually installed (observed `channel`: `'bearer'` for
  Authorization-header presentation without the session cookie, else
  `'cookie'`), and reports `methods: 'unknown'` (no per-session
  method upstream). Auth.js fills the email claim with `methods`/`mfa`
  `'unknown'` and declares no capabilities yet.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Generalized linking policy (PORT-3): core adds a declared
  `LinkingPolicy` discriminated union (`verified-email`, the default,
  plus opt-in `verified-email-or-phone`) with `defaultLinkingPolicy`, a
  strict `linkingPolicySchema`, and `parseLinkingPolicy`.
  `ensureLinkedUser` accepts an optional `linkingPolicy`; omitted or
  `verified-email` preserves the previous verified-email behavior
  exactly. The opt-in branch links a phone-only identity carrying a
  verified phone claim to an _existing_ user resolved through the new
  optional `UserRepository.findByPhone` port method — it never
  provisions, and every phone-only refusal is
  `UnverifiedIdentityError`. Anonymous identities never link under any
  policy — intentionally including when the identity was previously
  linked (D3): the anonymous gate runs before the already-linked fast
  path, so an anonymous session for a linked identity is refused, not
  verified. The plugin accepts a validated `linkingPolicy` option and
  passes it through to the session service; `verified-email-or-phone`
  additionally requires every registered provider to declare the
  `'phone'` capability (PORT-2 `assertCapabilities`, enforced at
  wiring) and currently fails fast at wiring because the Payload users
  collection has no phone field (and the repository no `findByPhone`)
  until CAP-9.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Session wire contract gains optional facts (PORT-4): plugin-level
  `Session` and the `SessionUser` wire shape now carry optional
  `assurance` (`methods`/`mfa`), `actor` (`{ providerUserId }`, only
  while impersonating), and `organizationId` (only when a
  provider-native tenant is active). The plugin projects them from the
  provider session onto the session endpoint response and the Payload
  auth strategy user; the web verifier and `require*` helpers and the
  React provider pass them through. Back-compatible by construction:
  payloads without the fields still parse, producers omit a field
  unless it is known, and a reported `assurance` serializes even when
  its values are `'unknown'` — consumers must treat absent and
  `'unknown'` alike as not satisfied (fail closed). The client wire
  parser is forward-compatible: unknown keys inside
  `assurance`/`actor` are ignored and a present-but-malformed
  optional degrades fail-closed-for-policy (`assurance` to
  `'unknown'`, `actor`/`organizationId` to absent) instead of failing
  the whole user, while core identity fields stay strict. Server-side
  authorization/audit never use that parser: the plugin's fail-closed
  server extraction treats a present-but-malformed `actor` on
  `req.user` as impersonating (deny + audit). See `docs/upgrading.md`.

- [#12](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/12) [`2eced30`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/2eced3044f96a02bbc0f57f61345a958054030f4) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Add the provider conformance kit at the new test-only subpath export `@payload-auth-link/core/testing` (PORT-5): `assertProviderConformance` / `checkProviderConformance` take a port factory plus scenario drivers and assert session-shape narrowing and verified-claim semantics (including the deprecated `email`/`emailVerified` aliases matching the claim), declared capabilities matching behavior (`revokeUserSessions` exists iff `'revoke-user-sessions'` is declared, declared `'impersonation'`/`'mfa'` must be observable), actor propagation, channel reporting, and revoke semantics — with an explicit `best-effort` revoke mode for stateless JWT transports. It is framework- and test-framework-free, re-validates sessions at runtime, and both provider adapters now run it in their test suites. No runtime behavior changes.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/4) [`04f8e49`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/04f8e49d79567d3e85b7d34cb91e840f7d9efd74) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Packaging fixes found by verifying 0.1.0 from a clean consumer install:

  - next: `dist` imported `next/headers`, `next/navigation` and
    `next/server` without `.js`, so the adapter crashed under plain
    Node ESM (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). The imports now carry `.js`, and
    lint enforces it.
  - plugin: `@payload-auth-link/plugin/admin` imports `@payloadcms/ui`
    but never declared it. It is now an optional peer dependency (only
    the `/admin` subpath needs it, and Payload apps already have it).
  - all: compiled tests (`dist/**/__tests__`) no longer ship in the
    tarballs (0.1.0 `core` carried 56 test files).
  - all: every package now ships a README, so its npm page explains the

### Minor Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`70e87c3`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/70e87c3c3bfdda54f9ebdca5b074ac2635f7aed8) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Close the low-severity review backlog. Every change fails closed; see
  docs/upgrading.md.

  - core: `safeRedirectPath` moves to core with a destination policy
    that refuses the sign-in page and `/api` (`SafeRedirectOptions`).
    New exports: `isCookieName` and `SafeRedirectOptions`. Cookie
    `Domain`/`Path` values that could inject attributes or split
    headers throw. Provider registration rejects illegal session cookie
    names. `validateStartupConfig` drops the unused `secret`.
  - plugin: `secret` is deprecated and ignored. An empty provider
    session id is a 401, not a 500. Logout already sweeps every
    provider (PAR-7).
  - web: `requireRoles` validates its roles (`InvalidRoleError`, and
    `InvalidConfigError` for an empty list). It re-exports
    `SafeRedirectOptions`.
  - react: `SignOutButton` narrows `redirectTo`. `AuthLinkProvider`
    syncs a changed `initialUser` (value-compared, so a client sign-out
    is never undone by an equal snapshot).
  - next, tanstack-start: re-export the whole web surface through one
    shared statement, so adapters cannot drift (now includes
    `SafeRedirectOptions`).
  - provider-authjs: `authorize` lowercases the email. A corrupt
    `emailVerified` throws `AdapterMappingError`. Gapped session chunk
    sets are malformed.
  - provider-better-auth: adapter rows assert `baId` and date fields,
    and throw `AdapterOperationError` on storage drift.

- [#1](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/pull/1) [`b010bea`](https://github.com/jellologic/payload-auth-link/commit/b010bea61a807e9400ebe944e9424463d7f55085) Thanks [@jellologic](https://github.com/jellologic)! - Enterprise review hardening.

  Security fixes:

  - Logout now expires session cookies with their live attributes
    (`Secure`, `Domain`, `Path`) reported by each provider through the
    new optional `IdentityProviderPort.sessionCookieClearOptions` hook,
    so `__Secure-` and custom-domain cookies actually die. Providers
    that predate the hook fall back to prefix-derived attributes
    (`expiringCookieOptions`).
  - New `safeRedirectPath` guard in `@payload-auth-link/next`: the
    post-login `redirect` param is attacker-controlled input and must
    never reach the router unvalidated (open redirect).
  - New server authorization helpers `requireSessionUser` /
    `requireRoles` in `@payload-auth-link/next` (throw
    `SessionInvalidError` / `ForbiddenError` by default; pass
    `redirect()` / `notFound()` as handlers). `RequireRoles` is
    UI-hiding only and must never gate content.
  - Auth.js credentials `authorize` burns a dummy scrypt verification
    for unknown emails and hashless rows, closing the
    user-enumeration timing oracle.
  - Session reads anchor to the configured `baseUrl`/`AUTH_URL` origin
    whenever set; the request-host fallback is local-development only
    (host headers are client-spoofable and session cookies are
    forwarded to that origin).

  Strictness and consistency:

  - Better Auth `AdapterOperationError` now extends `AuthLinkError`
    (code `ADAPTER_OPERATION_FAILED`) like its Auth.js twin; it moved
    from `adapter.js` to `errors.js` (barrel import unchanged).
  - Slug overrides validate at wiring time in both providers
    (`resolveSlugs`: non-empty, known models) and collections reject
    slug collisions (`assertUniqueSlugs`), including custom-model
    slugs against core slugs; new `customModelSlug` helper.
  - Shared core building blocks replace nine local copies:
    `isRecord` / `isNonEmptyString` / `toDate` guards,
    `runProviderOperation` port-call wrapper, `denyAllAccess` system
    collection default, `secureCookiePrefix` / `hostCookiePrefix`
    constants. The Edge-safe `/cookies` subpaths keep local literals
    (runtime-import-free) pinned to core by tests.
  - `CookieOptions` gains `partitioned`; `SessionVerifier` is now a
    named export.
